# Analysis of longitudinal data

### The RATS dataset

We begin by reading in the RATS data set:

```{r}
RATSL <- read.csv("data/RATSL.csv", row.names = 1)
RATSL$ID <- factor(RATSL$ID)
RATSL$Group <- factor(RATSL$Group)

dim(RATSL)
str(RATSL)
```
The RATS data set consists of 176 observations of 5 variables (of longitudinal data). The data is from a study on the weight gain of three groups of rats (16 rats total) on different diets over a period of 64 days.

We plot the weight developments of the rat groups as follows:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(RATSL, aes(x = Time, y = Weight, group = ID)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(. ~ Group, labeller = label_both) +
  # theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(RATSL$Weight), max(RATSL$Weight)))
```

From the plots we see that the rats in Group 1 are about half the weight of the 
rats in the other groups, and there are twice as many of them. In Group 2, we see that there is an outlier rat of a much heavier weight than the others. Overall, it appears that all rats gained weight during the study, but rats in Groups 2 and 3 gained more absolute weight than the rats in Group 1.

To compare the weight gain better, let us standardize the weights: 

```{r}
RATSL <- RATSL %>%
  group_by(Time) %>%
  mutate(stdWeight = (Weight - mean(Weight))/sd(Weight)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(RATSL, aes(x = Time, y = stdWeight, group = ID)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(. ~ Group, labeller = label_both) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "standardized Weight")
```

The standardized weight plots tell us that the rats in Group 2 appeared to gain more relative weight on average than rats in the other groups. Compared to their initial weight, rats in Group 3 appear to have gained the least weight, with the rats in Group 2 positioned somewhere in the middle.

Mean response profiles:

```{r}
n <- RATSL$Time %>% unique() %>% length()

RATSS <- RATSL %>%
  group_by(Group, Time) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Weight), se = sd(Weight)/sqrt(n)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(RATSS, aes(x = Time, y = mean, linetype = Group, shape = Group)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(1,2,3)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1,2,3)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se, linetype="1"), width=0.3) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9,0.5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "mean(Weight) +/- se(Weight)")
```

Boxplots:

```{r}
RATSL8S <- RATSL %>%
  filter(Time > 1) %>%
  group_by(Group, ID) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Weight)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(RATSL8S, aes(x = Group, y = mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", geom = "point", shape=23, size=4, fill = "white") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "mean(Weight), weeks 2-9")
```

Boxplot without outliers:


```{r}
RATSL8S1 <- RATSL8S %>%
  filter(mean > 250 & mean < 550 & (mean < 475 | mean > 525))

ggplot(RATSL8S1, aes(x = Group, y = mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", geom = "point", shape=23, size=4, fill = "white") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "mean(Weight), weeks 2-9")
```

Test:

```{r}
RATS <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KimmoVehkalahti/MABS/master/Examples/data/rats.txt", sep="", header=TRUE)

RATSL8S2 <- RATSL8S %>%
  mutate(baseline = RATS$WD1)

fit <- lm(mean ~ baseline + Group, data = RATSL8S2)

anova(fit)
```

### The BPRS dataset

We read in the BPRS data set:

```{r}
BPRSL <- read.csv("data/BPRSL.csv", row.names = 1)
BPRSL$treatment <- factor(BPRSL$treatment)
BPRSL$subject <- factor(BPRSL$subject)

ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x = week, y = bprs, linetype = subject)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ treatment, labeller = label_both) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(BPRSL$bprs), max(BPRSL$bprs)))
```

Linear regression model:

```{r}
BPRS_reg <- lm(bprs ~ week + treatment, data = BPRSL)
summary(BPRS_reg)
```

Random intercept model:

```{r}
library(lme4)

BPRS_ref <- lmer(bprs ~ week + treatment + (1 | subject), data = BPRSL, REML = FALSE)
summary(BPRS_ref)
```

Random intercept and random slope model:

```{r}
BPRS_ref1 <- lmer(bprs ~ week + treatment + (week | subject), data = BPRSL, REML = FALSE)
summary(BPRS_ref1)
anova(BPRS_ref1, BPRS_ref)
```

Random intercept and random slope model with interaction:

```{r}
BPRS_ref2 <- lmer(bprs ~ week * treatment + (week | subject), data = BPRSL, REML = FALSE)

summary(BPRS_ref2)
anova(BPRS_ref2, BPRS_ref1)

ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x = week, y = bprs, linetype = subject)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ treatment, labeller = label_both) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(BPRSL$bprs), max(BPRSL$bprs)))

Fitted <- fitted(BPRS_ref2)

BPRSL <- BPRSL %>%
  mutate(Fitted)

#ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x = week, y = Fitted, group = subject)) +
#  geom_line(aes(linetype = treatment)) +
#  scale_x_continuous(name = "week", breaks = seq(0, 60, 20)) +
#  scale_y_continuous(name = "Fitted bprs") +
#  theme(legend.position = "top")

ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x = week, y = Fitted, linetype = subject)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ treatment, labeller = label_both) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(BPRSL$Fitted), max(BPRSL$Fitted)))
```
